# Uncaught Error: Failed to compile with @apply in Tailwind CSS
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive. The error, "Uncaught Error: Failed to compile," typically arises from issues with the referenced styles.  This example showcases how to identify and solve such issues.

## Bug Description
The `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS allows you to apply pre-defined styles. However, if there's a typo in the class name, the referenced styles are not defined, or there are conflicting styles, this error can occur.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking:

1. **Typographical errors**: Ensure that the class name used in `@apply` exactly matches a defined class in your Tailwind configuration.
2. **Correct style definition**: Verify that the referenced style is correctly defined and accessible within your CSS.
3. **Style conflicts**: Resolve any possible conflicts with other styles that might be interfering.
